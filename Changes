Changelog for POE::Component::Client::Ident:-
=============================================

0.7	Fri Apr 29 10:51:22 BST 2005
	- Amended Ident.pm so that it only stashes child session IDs
	  not the session objects themselves.
	- Doh, had forgotten to include 'use Socket' in Ident.pm.

0.6	Fri Apr 22 12:00:56 BST 2005
	- Hopefully fixed the issues that _pRiVi was having.

0.5	Sat Apr 16 11:26:37 BST 2005
	- _pRiVi @ MAGnet teased a bug in _time_out.

0.4	Tue Feb  8 12:55:40 GMT 2005
	- Added an additional delay _time_out to Ident-Agent.pm, so
	  that it'll properly timeout on firewalled hosts/ports.
